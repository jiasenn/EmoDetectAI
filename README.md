# EmoDetectAI
The project problem that is being addressed is the need for accurate facial and emotion detection using AI technology. Mainly focusing on training models using deep learning models.

Data used is obtained from kaggle.com and is a dataset of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The dataset consists of 7 different emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral. The training set consists of 28,709 examples and the public test set consists of 3,589 examples.

The model is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and is able to achieve an accuracy of 90% on the test set.

## Getting Started
We mainly uses tensorflow and pytorch for the training and testing of our data. We also use the following libraries:
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
